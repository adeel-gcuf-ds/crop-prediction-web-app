🚜🌾 Exciting Project Alert: Machine Learning for Crop Yield Prediction with Streamlit and Python! 🌾🚜

We're thrilled to share our latest project that dives into the fascinating intersection of machine learning and agriculture. Our goal is to enhance crop yield prediction by leveraging both remote sensing and deep learning technologies. 🌍🤖

🛠️ Project Overview:
Recent studies highlight that remote sensing is an effective tool for yield estimation. By integrating diverse datasets, including satellite data, climate data, and soil data, we can improve prediction accuracy. However, current methods face challenges, especially in combining time-series and constant data effectively. Our project addresses these issues by proposing a novel Multi-Level Deep Learning (MLDL) model that integrates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract both spatial and temporal features from the data.

📊 Dataset Details:
Our dataset includes 8 crucial variables:

Nitrogen (N): Nitrogen content in the soil.
Phosphorus (P): Phosphorus content in the soil.
Potassium (K): Potassium content in the soil.
Temperature: Average temperature in Celsius during the crop growth period.
Humidity: Average relative humidity during the crop growth period.
pH: Soil pH level (acidity or alkalinity).
Rainfall: Total rainfall in mm during the crop growth period.
Label: The type of crop being grown.
🚀 Tools & Technologies:
Machine Learning & Deep Learning: RNN & CNN
Data Sources: Satellite data, climate data, soil data
Frameworks: Streamlit for creating an interactive interface, Python for model development.
🌟 Join Us on This Journey!
We're excited to see how this innovative approach can push the boundaries of agricultural technology. Stay tuned for updates on our progress and results!
